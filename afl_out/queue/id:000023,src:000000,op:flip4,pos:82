AFL starting test cases

../docs/README fl.)

The a
chives/, images/, multimedia/hers/ subdirectories contain smastandalone files that can be used to seed afl-fuzz when testing parsers for a
variety of common data formats.

There is probably not much to be saidhese files, except that they were
optimized for size and stripped of any non-essential fluff. Some directories
contain several examples that exercise various features of the underlying format.
For example, there is a PNG file with and without a color profile.

Additional test cases are always welcome.

In addition to well-chosen starting files, many fuzzing jobs benefit from a
small and concise dictionary. See ../dictionaries/README.dictionaries for more.
